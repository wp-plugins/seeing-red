== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the idea behind this plugin? =

I work with a lot of people who are new to WordPress, and they are just never aware of the Screen Options tab. It's one of those things that you need only rarely, that power WP users are well aware of, and that is a complete mystery to noobs.

= Is it possible to hide one or both of the tabs? =

Not with this release, but I will add that if there is interest.
