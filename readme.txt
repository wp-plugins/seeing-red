== Description ==

This plugin only does one simple thing: it makes your "Screen Options" and "Help" tabs at the top of your screen more noticeable. 

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `seeing_red.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. That's it

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did you create this plugin? =

I work with a lot of people who are new to WordPress, and they are just never aware of the Screen Options tab. It's one of those things that you need only rarely, that power WP users are well aware of, and that is a complete mystery to noobs.

= Plans for updates? =

No, other than to let users choose which color scheme they would like. Just because you're working on the backend doesn't mean you shouldn't have a nice view. 

== Screenshots ==

1. The appearance of the "Screen Options" and "Help" tabs after installing and activating Seeing Red.
2. The appearance of the open "Screen Options" tab in the "Posts" pane.
3. The appearance of the open "Help" tab in the "Posts" pane.

== Changelog ==
